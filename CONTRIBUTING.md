## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

**Before creating a bug report**, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/Shinobi-Open-Source-Academy-SOS-Academy/sos-academy-platform/issues) to avoid duplicates.

**When creating a bug report**, include:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Environment details (OS, browser, Node version)
- Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Enhancements

**Enhancement suggestions** are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful
- Include mockups or examples if applicable

### Contributing Code

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Small fixes** (typos, docs, small bugs) can be submitted directly
2. **Larger changes** should have an associated issue for discussion first
3. **New features** require prior discussion and approval from maintainers

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/updates
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

### 3. Commit Your Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
git commit -m "fix: resolve email validation bug"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test updates
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üì• Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows our coding standards
- [ ] All tests pass: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Code is properly formatted: `pnpm check`
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commits follow conventional commit format
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main

### PR Title Format

Use the same format as commits:

```

fix: resolve database connection issue
docs: update contribution guidelines
```

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Related Issue
Fixes #(issue number)

## Screenshots (if applicable)
Add screenshots here

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
```

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD, linting, tests)
2. **At least one maintainer** must approve
3. **All conversations** must be resolved
4. **No merge conflicts** with main branch
5. **Squash and merge** will be used for merging

## üíª Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, self-documenting code
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- **DRY Principle**: Don't repeat yourself - reuse code where possible
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow SOLID design principles
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Use **functional components** in React
- Use **async/await** over promises when possible
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use **const** by default, **let** when needed, avoid **var**

### Formatting

We use **Biome** for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
pnpm format

# Check formatting
pnpm format:check

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Check everything
pnpm check:fix
```

**Pre-commit hook** automatically formats code before commits.

### File Organization

- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Classes/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Components**: `PascalCase`
- **Hooks**: `useCamelCase`

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create a new user successfully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
