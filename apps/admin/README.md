## Environment Setup

**Backend `.env` (root level):**
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@shinobi-open-source.academy
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

```

## Admin User Seeding

The admin user is **automatically created** on server startup if it doesn't exist. You can also manually manage it:

```bash
# Seed admin user manually (creates if doesn't exist)
pnpm seed:admin

# Reset admin user (deletes and recreates)
pnpm seed:admin:reset
```

> ✅ **Auto-Seed:** When the server starts, it automatically checks and creates the admin user if missing.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/seeder/admin/seed` - Create admin user
- `POST /api/seeder/admin/reset` - Reset admin user
- `POST /api/seeder/admin/clear` - Delete admin user

The admin user is created with:
- **Role:** KAGE
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Password:** Hashed using bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- **Email & Password:** From `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in backend `.env`

## Production

Change credentials in backend `.env`:
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

Then reset the admin user to apply the new credentials:
```bash
pnpm seed:admin:reset
```
