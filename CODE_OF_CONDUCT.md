This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)

- Email communications
- Social media interactions
- Community events (online or offline)

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@shinobi-open-source.academy**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an issue, please include:

  - When and where it occurred
  - What happened
  - Any relevant context
- Links to any public records (issues, PRs, etc.)

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
